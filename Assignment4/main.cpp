/* Classifies Quadrilaterals according to https://www.varsitytutors.com/hotmath/hotmath_help/topics/quadrilaterals.
 In particular, see the Venn diagram at the bottom of the page. Always classify a quadrilateral as precisely as possible. In other words, a square is also a rectangle, but since "square" is the more precise classification it is what you should print.
 Your input arrives on the standard input stream and is a list of quadrilaterals, one per line. Each line describes 3 vertices, which should be treated as arriving in clockwise order, starting from an implied first vertex at 0,0.
 Input lines are of the form:
 x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
 All input values are integers in the range 0..100 (inclusive).
 Does not do input validation.
